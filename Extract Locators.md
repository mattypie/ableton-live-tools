# Extract Locators

`src/extract_locators.py` extracts Ableton Live arrangement locators from an `.als` session file and writes timestamped tracklists. It is designed for preparing time and label exports for show notes, livestream descriptions, Mixcloud uploads, and other post-production notes.

The script uses only the Python 3 standard library.

## Release Notes

### 2026.05.16

- Moved the Python script from the repository root to `src/extract_locators.py`.
- Added this guide-meets-release-notes document at `Extract Locators.md`.
- Simplified `README.md` so it gives a high-level project overview and links here for full Extract Locators documentation.
- Optimized ALS parsing by streaming only the locator and tempo data needed by the tool instead of building the full Ableton XML tree in memory.
- Replaced linear tempo segment lookup with `bisect` over precomputed tempo beat positions.
- Batched TSV and Mixcloud file writes with `writelines`.
- On the `RYM_2026-03.als` test session, elapsed runtime improved from `1.035s` to `0.769s`, about `26%` less elapsed time.
- On the `RYM_2026-03.als` test session, peak memory use improved from about `699 MiB` to about `26.8 MiB`, about `96%` less peak memory.
- Verified the optimized output is byte-identical to the previous implementation for the same command-line options.

### 2026.05

- Added support for pre-roll offsets, including session data that extends before `1.1.1` or projects where `1.1.1` has been moved.
- Added support for tempo changes and linear tempo ramps so locator timestamps are calculated against the actual session timeline.
- Added TSV output with configurable heading labels.
- Added `--no-heading-row` and `--no-header` to omit TSV headings entirely.
- Added optional Mixcloud-compatible output.
- Added optional stripping of leading musical key labels from locator names.
- Added support for both plain XML `.als` files and gzip-compressed `.als` files.

## What It Does

Ableton `.als` files are XML documents, often gzip-compressed. Extract Locators reads the session, finds arrangement locators, calculates their real elapsed time, and exports timestamped labels.

Timing is calculated with awareness of:

- Tempo automation events.
- Linear tempo ramps.
- Locator normalization, so the earliest extracted locator starts at `00:00` before any user offset is applied.
- User-specified positive or negative offsets.

## Basic Usage

Run the script from the repository root with an Ableton session path:

```bash
python3 src/extract_locators.py path/to/song.als
```

If no output file is specified, the script writes `<input filename>.txt` in the current directory. For example, running the command with `song.als` creates `song.als.txt`.

## TSV Output

The default TSV output has two columns:

```text
Time    Locator Name
00:00   First Track
01:28   Second Track
```

Use `--output` or `-o` to choose the TSV output path:

```bash
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --output=locators.tsv
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als -o locators.tsv
```

## Mixcloud Output

Use `--mixcloud` or `-m` to also write a Mixcloud-compatible timestamped tracklist:

```bash
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --mixcloud=mixcloud.txt
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als -m mixcloud.txt
```

Mixcloud output uses one timestamp and label per line:

```text
00:00 First Track
01:28 Second Track
```

## Timing Options

Use `--add-offset=SECONDS` to shift every locator after normalization. Fractional and negative values are accepted:

```bash
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --add-offset=27
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --add-offset=27.5
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --add-offset=-3.25
```

Use `--precision=DECIMALS` to include decimal seconds in TSV timestamps:

```bash
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --precision=2 --output=locators.tsv
```

With `--precision=0`, timestamps are written as `MM:SS`. With decimal precision, timestamps are written as `MM:SS.sss`.

Mixcloud output always uses whole-second timestamps.

## Heading Options

The default TSV heading row is:

```text
Time    Locator Name
```

Use `--time-header` and `--label-header` to customize those labels:

```bash
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --time-header=TIME --label-header=LABEL --output=ensemble.tsv
```

Use `--no-heading-row` or `--no-header` to omit the heading row entirely:

```bash
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --no-heading-row --output=locators.tsv
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --no-header --output=locators.tsv
```

`--no-heading-row` cannot be combined with `--time-header` or `--label-header`.

## Locator Name Cleanup

Use `--strip-keys` to remove a leading musical key in parentheses from locator names:

```bash
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --strip-keys --output=locators.tsv
```

Examples of stripped prefixes include:

- `(G#)`
- `(Gb)`
- `(A#m)`
- `(F Minor)`
- `(C Major)`

Sharp and flat symbols are also supported when they appear in the locator name.

## Combined Examples

Apply a 27-second offset, strip leading key labels, write a TSV without a heading row, and also write a Mixcloud file:

```bash
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --add-offset=27 --strip-keys --no-heading-row --output=locators.tsv --mixcloud=mixcloud.txt
```

Write decimal timestamps and custom TSV column labels:

```bash
python3 src/extract_locators.py song.als --precision=2 --time-header=TIME --label-header=LABEL --output=ensemble.tsv
```

## Terminal Output

The script prints a short status report after it runs. Successful output includes:

- The input session path.
- The number of locators processed.
- The output file path.
- The Mixcloud file path, when requested.
- The elapsed processing time.

Errors use the same compact reporting format for issues such as missing files, unreadable files, invalid option combinations, malformed XML, or invalid tempo data.

## Notes For Maintainers

The current parser streams Ableton XML with Python's Expat parser and collects only the data needed for locator extraction:

- Tempo automation envelopes identified by Ableton `PointeeId=8`.
- Arrangement `Locator` elements.

After parsing, tempo events are sorted, integrated into elapsed seconds, and searched with `bisect` when converting locator beat positions to real time. This keeps the script fast on large `.als` files while preserving the standard-library-only design.

When updating the script, keep this document current with:

- New command-line options.
- Changed output formats.
- New release notes.
- Any compatibility or behavior changes.
